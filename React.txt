Shallow Dom and Virtual Dom
   Shadow DOM works by allowing us to attach a hidden, separate Document Object Model (DOM) to an element. 
   This hidden DOM is known as the Shadow DOM 
   while Virtual DOM is like a lightweight copy of the Real DOM,
         manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as compare to Real DOM.
         It forms a node tree elements, their attributes, and content as JS Objects and their properties.
         and When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, 
         rather than updating all the objects
